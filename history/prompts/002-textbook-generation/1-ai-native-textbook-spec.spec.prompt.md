## Prompt

Feature: textbook-generation Objective: Define a complete, unambiguous specification for building the AI-native textbook with RAG chatbot. Book Structure: 1. Introduction to Physical AI 2. Basics of Humanoid Robotics 3. ROS 2 Fundamentals 4. Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo + Isaac) 5. Vision-Language-Action Systems 6. Capstone Technical Requirements: - Docusaurus - Auto sidebar - RAG backend (Qdrant + Neon) - Free-tier embeddings Optional: - Urdu translation - Personalize chapter Output: Full specification.

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive feature specification for an AI-native textbook with RAG chatbot. The specification includes:
- 6 chapters as specified (Introduction to Physical AI, Basics of Humanoid Robotics, ROS 2 Fundamentals, Digital Twin Simulation, Vision-Language-Action Systems, Capstone)
- User stories for textbook generation, RAG integration, free-tier operation, and chapter personalization
- Functional requirements with priorities
- Success criteria that are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Resolution of clarification questions (Urdu translation postponed, personalization limited to chapter selection)
- Quality checklist confirming specification completeness

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete feature specification created for AI-native textbook with RAG functionality
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements.md in specs/002-textbook-generation/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase (/sp.plan)
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully translated technical requirements into user-focused stories with clear acceptance criteria

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All checklist items passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
