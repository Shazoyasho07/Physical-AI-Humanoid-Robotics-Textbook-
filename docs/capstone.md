# Capstone: Simple AI-Robot Pipeline

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, we'll combine all the concepts from previous chapters to create a simple AI-robot pipeline that demonstrates:
- Integration of perception, planning, and action
- Use of simulation for development and testing
- Implementation of natural language interaction

## System Architecture

The pipeline consists of:

1. **Perception Module**: Processes sensor data to understand the environment
2. **Language Module**: Interprets natural language commands
3. **Planning Module**: Generates action sequences based on goals
4. **Control Module**: Executes actions on the physical or simulated robot

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
Set up a simulated environment using Gazebo with a mobile manipulator robot.

### Step 2: Perception Pipeline
Implement object detection and localization using computer vision techniques.

### Step 3: Natural Language Processing
Integrate a language model to interpret commands like "Pick up the red block" or "Navigate to the blue area."

### Step 4: Planning and Control
Create a planning system that generates executable trajectories for the robot.

### Step 5: Integration and Testing
Combine all components and test with various commands in simulation.

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this capstone, you will have:
- A working AI-robot pipeline
- Experience in system integration
- Understanding of real-world robotics challenges
- A foundation for more advanced projects
