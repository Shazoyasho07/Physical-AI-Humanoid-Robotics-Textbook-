# Introduction to Physical AI

## Overview

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces to AI systems that interact directly with the physical world. This field combines advanced machine learning techniques with physical systems to create intelligent agents that can perceive, reason, and act in real-world environments.

## Key Concepts

- **Embodied Cognition**: The idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment
- **Perception-Action Loops**: Continuous cycles of sensing, reasoning, and acting
- **Physical Reasoning**: Understanding and predicting the behavior of objects in 3D space

## Applications

Physical AI has applications across numerous domains including robotics, automated manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, and human-computer interaction. The technology enables systems to understand and manipulate the physical world in ways previously thought to require human-level intelligence.
