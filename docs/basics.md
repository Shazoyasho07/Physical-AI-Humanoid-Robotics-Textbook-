# Basics of Humanoid Robotics

## Introduction

Humanoid robotics focuses on creating robots with human-like form and functionality. These robots are designed to operate in human environments and potentially interact with humans in intuitive ways.

## Anatomy of Humanoid Robots

- **Degrees of Freedom**: The number of independent movements a robot can perform
- **Actuators**: Motors and servos that enable movement
- **Sensors**: Cameras, touch sensors, and other devices for environmental awareness
- **Control Systems**: Algorithms that coordinate movements and behaviors

## Challenges in Humanoid Design

Creating effective humanoid robots requires addressing numerous challenges:

- **Balance and Locomotion**: Maintaining stability while walking or performing tasks
- **Dexterity**: Achieving fine motor control similar to human hands
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Designing natural interfaces for communication
- **Energy Efficiency**: Maximizing operation time while minimizing power consumption
