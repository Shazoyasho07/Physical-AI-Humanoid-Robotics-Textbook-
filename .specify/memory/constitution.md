# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Essentials Constitution

## Core Principles

### Simplicity
All content and code must follow the principle of simplicity. Complex concepts should be broken down into digestible parts. Implementation details should be minimal and straightforward, avoiding over-engineering.

### Accuracy
All technical content must be factually accurate and up-to-date. Information presented about Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics must reflect current best practices and research. Accuracy is verified through cross-referencing and testing.

### Minimalism
The textbook and its associated tools should follow minimalist design principles. Unnecessary features or content should be avoided. Only essential elements that directly contribute to learning outcomes should be included.

### Fast Builds
The build process for the textbook and associated tools must be optimized for speed. Long build times impede development velocity and learning effectiveness. Efficiency in all processes is mandatory.

### Free-tier Architecture
All architectural decisions must accommodate free-tier hosting and deployment options. Resource consumption should remain within free-tier limits. Solutions should be cost-effective for students and educators.

### RAG Answers from Book Text Only
The RAG chatbot must provide answers exclusively based on content from the textbook. External information sources are prohibited to ensure accuracy and alignment with course material.

## Technical Constraints
The project must avoid heavy GPU usage and minimize embeddings as per the project requirements. Implementation must be lightweight and efficient to run on standard hardware.

## Development Workflow
All features must be tested for build success, chatbot accuracy, UI cleanliness, and GitHub Pages deployment before release. Each component must meet defined quality standards.

## Governance
This constitution governs all development decisions for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. All PRs and reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
